    An particularly interesting course: "TNCG15 - Advanced Global Illumination and Rendering"
    allowed me and my friend Tilda to deep dive into the world of raytracing. The implementation is a total from scratch
    (except for one library used to produce a bitmap image format) implementation of a monte carlo raytracing
    rendering engine written in C++. The solution handles different material types aswell as light sources and mirror
    surfaces! Other than the pretty results presented below, the project also provided some hilarious bugged out images.
